1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this SRS document is to describe the functional and non-functional requirements for the Smart Waste Segregation and Recycling System (SWSRS). This system is designed to automate the segregation of waste into various categories such as biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable materials. It aims to promote efficient waste management through intelligent classification, monitoring, and reporting.

1.2 Scope

The Smart Waste Segregation and Recycling System combines sensors, a microcontroller, and software intelligence to identify and separate waste automatically. The system uses sensors (e.g., infrared, moisture, and metal detectors) and image recognition to detect material types. Data is collected and transmitted to a cloud or local dashboard, allowing municipalities or users to monitor waste levels and recycling statistics.
The system benefits residential societies, industries, and local authorities by:

Reducing manual waste segregation effort.

Improving recycling rates.

Providing real-time waste monitoring and analytics.
